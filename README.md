# The Toolbox
This is my manual to all of the tools that I have used and learned to be valuable throughout my learning in cybersecurity. these are comprised of both offensive and defensive tools. 

Many of these tools will be link to one another for easier updates instead of all being in one file. I will try to keep this page up to date as an index of sorts. 

For the best reading experience download and install Obsidian for note taking. You can get this at https://obsidian.md. Obsidian is cross platform and works on Linux, MacOS and Windows clients.
