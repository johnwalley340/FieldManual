This is a great tool fro bypassing open WiFi captive portals. Simply connect to the WiFi SSID you wish to join and run the program. This may not work if you have ufw running. 

You will need to install sipcalc and nmap for this script to really work. 

	sudo install sipcalc nmap
	cd ~/toolbox
	git clone https://github.com/priyankvadaliya/Hack-Captive-Portal.git
	cd Hack-Captive-Portal
	sudo chmod 755 hack-captive.sh
	
You can run the command by simply running the .sh file

	./hack-captive.sh
