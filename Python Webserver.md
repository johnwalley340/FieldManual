## Python Simple We Server

Python Simple HTTP server runs different based on Python version. Version2 should be deprecated by now but you may still find some old stuff out there. The two versions are below. In most cases this will be run on a local machine so Python three will be used most of the time. 

##### Python3 

	sudo python3 -m http.server <port>
	
##### Python

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer
