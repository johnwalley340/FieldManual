This is by for my favorite web directory fuzzing apps. 

Since a recent update now you have to tell the app you want to look for directories with the dir extension: gobuster dir

-u URL
-w Wordlist
-x extentions such as txt, php, html, etc.
-f to ignore certificate errors

	sudo apt install gobuster
