To install the Meatsploit framework visit: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Nightly-Installers The installer code is on this page. 

Metasploit is a very powerful platform with tons of up to date module but from time to time you will find you need to create or download newer Metasplit modules already written in ruby. In order to install these so metasploit can read them they need to be copied to the /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules folder. 

Once these files are copied to the folder you can run updatedb while inside the msfconsole. The number of update should update after running the updatedb command.
